This repository contains a simple program, roughly functionally equivalent to the [2015 robot's code](https://github.com/Wayzata/FRC-2264-2015), with most of the statements scooped out and replaced with TODOs. This is intended as an exercise for programmers who are new to the Robotics API, to give a practical example of how to do things.
